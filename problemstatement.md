Your company is in the process of updating its website, and they’ve hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site. But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90° and too large. Oof! You’re not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You’ll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.

Designer sent a zip file of the images which can be downloaded using "curl -c ./cookie -s -L "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=$11hg55-dKdHN63yJP20dMLAgPJ5oiTOHF" > /dev/null | curl -Lb ./cookie "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=`awk '/download/ {print $NF}' ./cookie`&id=11hg55-dKdHN63yJP20dMLAgPJ5oiTOHF" -o images.zip && sudo rm -rf cookie"

The images received are in the wrong format:
1 .tiff format
2 Image resolution 192x192 pixel (too large)
3 Rotated 90° anti-clockwise

The images required for the launch should be in this format:
1 .jpeg format
2 Image resolution 128x128 pixel
3 Should be straight
